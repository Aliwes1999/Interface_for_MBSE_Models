# TODO for Adding, Marking, and Deleting Entries in create.html

- [x] Update app/routes.py: Add global list for requirements, modify /create to handle GET (display) and POST (add new entry), add /mark/<id> and /delete/<id> routes.
- [x] Update app/templates/create.html: Add a form to add new entries, modify table to dynamically display entries with mark (toggle status) and delete buttons.
- [x] Run the app and test adding, marking, and deleting entries.
